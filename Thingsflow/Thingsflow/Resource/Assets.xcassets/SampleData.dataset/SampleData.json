When extending an external `swift.class` symbol that has a superclass, the respective `inheritsFrom` relationship between the extended `swift.class` symbol and its superclass symbol was emitted not only in the symbol graph file that includes the external `class`' symbol, but also in every symbol graph file that contains a `swift.extension` symbol extending the same `swift.class` symbol.\r\n\r\nE.g. in the following snippet both `External.symbols.json` as well as `Main@External.symbols.json` included the `inheritsFrom` relationship between `C` and `Superclass`.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n// \"External\" Target\r\npublic class Superclass { }\r\npublic class C: Superclass { }\r\n\r\n// \"Main\" Target\r\npublic extension C {\r\n    func foo() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this pull request resolves any GitHub issues, link them.\r\nFor information about linking a pull request to an issue, see:\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue\r\n-->\r\nThis bug has no associated issue or radar.",
